## How it works

### `GroupChannelMainActivity.kt`
It consists of two tabs, `ChannelListFragment` and `SampleSettingsFragment`. They are configured by the MainAdapter class.
- `ChannelListFragment` is provided by UIKit using the function `FragmentProviders.channelList.provide(Bundle())`. It shows channel lists of the user.
- `SampleSettingsFragment`: This is an example implementation that demonstates the setting screen related to the configuration of UIKit. You can edit user's profile and change global configuration like enabling dark theme.

### `Push notification`
You can check codes handles FCM Push notification in [MyFirebaseMessagingService.kt](../common/fcm/MyFirebaseMessagingService.kt)
